        <p>
          Even if you have a good product and marketing knowledge sometimes
          issues happen because of the personality clashes within your team.
          What makes your company unique is you and people around you. In order
          to help you improve organisational climate and team spirit we offer
          solutions based on the powerful social psychology such as
          transactional analysis. After in-depth diagnosis we propose different`
          organisational interventions.

          <h2>What is organisational diagnosis?</h2>
          <p>
            Organisational diagnosis is a set of different methods used to
            assess visible and invisible structural, behavioural and
            communication patterns within your company. Organisation diagnosis
            is implemented by the independent and trained counsellor.

          <h2>How does organisational diagnosis look like?</h2>
          <p>
            Organisational diagnosis begins with the initial interview with a
            consultant. In this first step agreement is made about specific
            insights that client wants to achieve. Those insights may relate to
            some specific issue (for example working with a “difficult”
            employee) or to diagnosis of the whole organisation.
          </p>
          <p>
            When performing diagnosis, we usually make interviews with several
            managers or/and employees. Each interview is performed in a very
            confidential way. This means that we protect identity of each
            interviewee when making a report with recommendations. In this way
            each employee can freely express her/his attitudes, opinions and
            feelings in safe environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Initial diagnosis is made through face to face interviews. Sometimes
            specific assessment tools can be used such as personality,
            workstyle, or motivational questionnaires. After initial diagnosis
            group team observations can be made. In simulations we give
            participants specific problems to solve working as a team. In real
            work observation we participate in real activities to provide
            insights about organisational behaviour.

          <h2>What is done after organisational diagnosis?</h2>
          <p>
            Different organisational interventions may be proposed after the
            initial organisational diagnosis. Most often those interventions are
            targeted to initiate changes and improve communication and
            organisational climate. In cases of large organisations, they can be
            targeted only to some parts of the organisational structure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Organisational interventions include different activities such as:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Individual coaching with managers and employees</li>
            <li>Training</li>
            <li>
              Change of behavioural patterns through simulated team activities
            </li>
            <li>
              Gaining insights through real activity observations (such as
              meetings or working together)
            </li>
            <li>Organisational structure changes</li>
            <li>Mentoring</li>
            <li>Team strategic planning in a “step by step” way</li>
