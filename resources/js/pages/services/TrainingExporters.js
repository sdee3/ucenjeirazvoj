          Instead of hiring us to explore markets for you learn how to do proper
          market research on your own. We organise customised training according
          to your needs. What is important to us is that we focus to the impact
          of training on your daily business. Contrary to many of the training
          delivered we do not measure only if participants like or dislike a
          training. Our evaluation is extended to measure a real impact and
          change of your business.

          <h2>Export market research training</h2>
          <p>
            This type of training is targeted to export- oriented companies and
            companies interests to expand into international markets. The
            training is delivered with the use of computers and internet

            training and trainees are guided through a number of exercises where
            they work on their company product and explore export information
            sources. Trainees are required to work on real business problems. If
            participants are from the same company some exercises are done in
            pairs or small groups. Below example describe 3 steps approach.
          </p>

          <h3>Step 1 – How to select an export market?</h3>

            trainees learn how to use international trade portals combined with
            qualitative data. After the training participants are enabled to
            base their decisions on real data about trade dynamics. They filter
            broader selection into markets with the best export potentials for
            their companies.

                requirements, prices, my export readiness, forecasts...

            information on export markets. Trainees learn how to use data
            sources and tools to find information about important aspects of
            foreign import markets including contacts of the potential buyers.
          </p>

          </ul>

          <h3>Step 3 – Contracting for learning</h3>
          <p>
            All trainees are required to apply knowledge back to the enterprise
            through the market research action plan developed through the
            course. Participants learn how to practically implement actions for
            daily business. Evaluation is implemented not only immediately after
            the training but through the longer time to measure the real
            business effect.

          <h2>Organisational and personal development training</h2>
          <p>
            Working with people in your and other organisations require a set of
            skills which are usually not taught in a practical manner during
            your official education. Being a successful exporter require more
            than export related skills and knowledge. You would need to
            efficiently integrate needs of your company with needs of your
            employees and clients in order to growth and develop. With
            customised training we can help you grow faster.
          </p>
          <p>
            One approach we prefer is to make interviews and assessments with
            the future training participants in order to create a training
            specifically suited to your needs. Another option is to go through
            specific set of standard topics and after that to decide which
            subject you would like to explore more. Some of the training topics
            we offer are:
